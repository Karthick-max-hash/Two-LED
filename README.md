# Two LEDs Blink with Arduino

This Arduino project blinks *two LEDs alternately* using digital pins 12 and 13. The simulation and circuit were created in Tinkercad.

---

## ðŸš€ What It Does

- Turns *LED 1 (pin 13)* ON and *LED 2 (pin 12)* OFF
- Waits for 2 second
- Then turns *LED 1 OFF* and *LED 2 ON*
- Repeats the cycle continuously

## ðŸ”Œ Circuit Details

| Arduino Pin | Component | Description        |
|-------------|-----------|--------------------|
| D13         | LED 1     | Long leg to D13, short leg to GND via 220Î© resistor |
| D12         | LED 2     | Long leg to D12, short leg to GND via 220Î© resistor |

## ðŸ“¦ Requirements

- Arduino UNO
- 2 x LEDs (any color)
- 2 x 220Î© resistors
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard (optional)
- USB cable for Arduino

## ðŸ’¾ Arduino Code

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(13, OUTPUT);  // LED 1
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT);  // LED 2
}

void loop() {
   digitalWrite(12, HIGH);
  delay(2000);
  digitalWrite(12,LOW);
  delay(2000);
  digitalWrite(13,HIGH);
  delay(2000);
  
  digitalWrite(13, LOW);
  
} 
}
